<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SAUS is a streamlined interface for AI Image and Video Generation using ComfyUI as backend Engine. 
"Spaghetti" node workflows converted into a clean, production-ready application environment.

### Why SAUS?
* **Simple:** Built for creators who need results without the node-induced headaches.
* **App:** A powerful wrapper that extends ComfyUI's capabilities into a standalone-app feel.
* **U See:** A clean, expansive "view" of your creative output—not just your backend.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

# ComfyUI via ComfyUI Manager

If you already have installed [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/), the easiest way is to do it via the Manager

[IMAGE HERE]


# ComfyUI Manual Install

In [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) root folder, navigate to the `custom_nodes` folder and run the following command:

Open the terminal, or in the address bar type CMD to open a command prompt, then run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diStyApps/ComfyUI-disty-Flow
```

# New installation - Windows [modified ]

If you have not yet installed ComfyUI, the following instructions will install comfyui portable with comfyui manager, ComfyUI-SAUS and the other custom nodes required to run the base workflows/apps

# New installation - Linux

If you have not yet installed ComfyUI, the following instructions will install comfyui portable with comfyui manager, ComfyUI-SAUS and the other custom nodes required to run the base workflows/apps

# Runpod - pods
Runpod offers rental of GPU's at a good price that can be used to run the latest image and video models. This is convenient as you do not need to keep grinding and optimizing workflows to get a sub-optimal quality in your results.

After signing up in Runpod, create a Network Disk (with enough capacity to run the models) and use the ComfyUI SUAVE template.
