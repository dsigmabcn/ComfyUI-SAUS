## Sidebar
Use the sidebar to navigate between different categories of Apps (workflows) and return to your home/landing page.
Check out: [App Browsing](APP_BROWSING.md)

## Top Navigation Bar
Navigate between:
- SAUS Apps: the landing/home page
- [File Manager](FILE_MANAGER.md): a simple manager for files in your ComfyUI installation 
- [ComfyUI](COMFYUI.md): access ComfyUI in a separate window
- [Settings](SETTINGS.md): save tokens for CivitAI, Hugging Face and SAUS for special apps

## Main Container:
In this section of the screen, the apps, file manager, or settings will be loaded.

## Updates:
If a newer version of the software is available, the 'updates' icon will appear. Click on it if you want to update it.

Click on 'Send me to ComfyUI to Update Now'. Currently, updates must be done via the ComfyUI Manager. When you click this, you will be taken to the ComfyUI graph. To access the manager, click the 'Manager' icon in the action bar on the top right.

ComfyUI Manager will pop up. Access the Custom Nodes Manager:

A list of all available custom nodes for ComfyUI will appear. Now, filter by installed custom nodes:

Search for 'SAUS' (the full name is ComfyUI-SAUS).

Then, click 'Try Update', and the node will begin updating from GitHub.

When the update is complete, you must restart ComfyUI. You will see a 'Restart' button appear at the bottom of the manager.

After ComfyUI has restarted, refresh your browser (F5) and click the SAUS button again.
